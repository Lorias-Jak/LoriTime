Currently LoriTime has two ways to store your data. The first is via .yml files, the other is via a database.<br>
Choose what suits you more, there are no restrictions by your choice<br>

## Types
> ⚠️ Note that you cannot migrate between different storage types!<br>
> ⚠️ Only MariaDB is tested, not mysql. In case you have any problems, pls report them<br>

| Type | Description | 
|------|-------------|
| yml | A file-based Storage |
| mysql | A database hosted on a MySQL or MariaDB server |

## Setting up the database
<p>To change the storage type, open your `config.yml` and enter all database properties.</p>
